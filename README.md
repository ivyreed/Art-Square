## Description

Getting tired of Instagram? tired of only getting a yes or no response on art that you have been working at nonstop for the last 12 years? Introducing Art Square! Here, your art will be rated 1-5 by the mass population! Getting a more precise idea of how good or bad your art looks could be the difference between you becoming the next Picasso, or becoming straight-up washed-out trash!
