## Description

Have you ever had good ideas and gained the motive to profit off of it? Just for that same good idea to flunk out and not reach any kind of clientele or attention. Or maybe you‚Äôre a business owner having a crisis because your business is failing.  Look no more!
We‚Äôre here to help you with your own personal Marketing Bestie. Maybe your good idea wasn‚Äôt so bad after all and maybe your business isn‚Äôt failing due to a lack of work ethic, maybe it‚Äôs just the lack of relevancy in terms of advertising! By using our Marketing Bestie app, you can now track your projects and use our search query to search keywords which will then show the keywords‚Äô analytics and trends. We‚Äôre here to start and/or save your business!!
